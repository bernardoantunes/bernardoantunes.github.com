## Me

My name is Bernardo Antunes!

I have made about everything in my software engineering career. And I got to a point to stop and decide what I really want to do for the next years.
Check my [Curriculum Vitae](/cv/).

If you want to contact me, you can email me at \[myself\] \[at\] \[this domain\]. ;)

For other activities, I like doing exercise, swimming and currently trainning Jujitsu.

## This Website

This site is my web identity and at the same time, the place to share ideas and a playground to test concepts about web development.

I have currently two projects/ideas in development about the future of web development. Don't worry, I will release the source code to have feedback and participation of the community about somethings that are everybody's concern. ;) 

**This site is built on top of:**

- HTML5 & CSS3 - Is there any other standard?
- HTML5Boilerplate - Don't start from the zero.
- Sass - CSS extended ;)
- Compass - Library of CSS patterns and best practices.
- Jekyll - Static site generator.
- GitHub Pages - hosted on GitHub.
- Markdown - To write the posts and others like this page.
- FitText - For my big welcome message.
- Unit Grid System - To make this site responsive and fluid in a simple way (I built it :)).

**And follows the following concepts:**

- Responsive - Try to resize it or see it from your tablet or smartphone.
- Fluid - Create for one resolution? Naaa, it adjusts to what you have.
- Elastic - Everything is relative, and it scales as needed.
- Vertical Rythm - Things look much better in rythm.
- Modular Scales - Composite modular scale of Golden with Fourth.
