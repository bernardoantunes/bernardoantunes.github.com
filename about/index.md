This page is a working draft, it will be updated very soon...

## Me

My name is Bernardo Antunes!

-- more info will be included here --

If you want to contact me, you can email me at myself at this domain. ;)

For other activities, I like doing exercise, swimming and currently trainning Jujitsu.

## This Website

This site is my web identity and at the same time, the location and a playground to test ideas about web development.

I have currently two projects/ideas in development about the future of web development. Don't worry, I will release the source code to have feedback and participation of the community about somethings that are everybody's concern. ;) 

If you want to know how this site was made, the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/bernardoantunes/bernardoantunes.github.com).
