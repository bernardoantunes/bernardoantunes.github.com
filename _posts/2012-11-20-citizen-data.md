##Context

When I talk about the management of my personal data by the government I normally get upset about several reasons:
It spreaded by so many services that I don't even know about then all
It's information is inconsistent between services
I have no simple control about it
My information is hidden and inaccessible
I have no way to give a controlled access to it be trusted entities
There is way to share anonymously my data with research entities
The 5 to 10 year interval between census makes me think how can the government know who their citizens are, where and how they are...

Integrate with the government data depends on a heterogeneity of services in wish each one have a different APIs with different features and requirements

That communication is unidirectional

And most of the time make direct access to the production servers that cannot stop if there is an overflow of requests

In Portugal if a citizen wants to authenticate himself to a government service, he just have to use his ID card, insert it in a smart car reader connected to your computer and insert your pin, after that you can make any request, access any service and even sign messages or documents with your citizen certificate.
Even your biometric data is there in case you are required to validate yourself in some more sensitive services.
You have an area for personal notes where you can write what you think that is important.

All this looks so well thought and organized, and the reality is that it really is and the potential of the platform is amazing and available to government and private alike.

The current limitation is that the different services don't share and many times don't even communicate between each other.

I am part of whole and my data is much valuable to me 

Lately there are some topics that are very popular, government open data, big data, citizen security and privacy, etc..
